## 🎯 Motivation

### 🧠 Why Zep?

Standard debounce functions are often *"fire and forget"* and can lead to **Timer Thrashing** - constantly creating and destroying timers during high-frequency events.  

`Zep` is built as a state machine. It uses a **single-timer** architecture that stays resident only as long as needed, managing execution through internal **state** flags and automatically cleans-up (via `clearInterval()`) when no longer needed.  

**Observability**: automatically calculates the percentage of execution **overhead saved** (e.g. `🧠 [Zep]: invocations: 500, callback executions: 32, saving 93.60% of calls.`).  

**Lifecycle Hooks**: tap into the execution flow with `onBeforeRun()`, `onAfterRun()`, and `onCompleted()`.  

**Fluent Interface**: clean, chainable configuration.  

**Dual-mode Termination**: Choose between a graceful `cancel()` or an immediate `abort()`.

<br>

## 🤖 Features

- ⚡ **Single-Timer Engine** - eliminates *"timer thrashing"* by using one persistent, state-managed interval instead of spawning hundreds of volatile timeouts
- 📊 **Built-in Telemetry** - real-time performance tracking. Monitor invocations vs. executions and see exactly how much execution overhead was saved
- 🚦 **State-Driven Architecture** - fine-grained visibility with `isWaiting` and `isRunning` flags, allowing an app to react to the debouncer's internal state
- 🎯 **Lifecycle Hooks** - a full suite of events (`onBefore`, `onAfter`, `onCompleted`, etc.) to orchestrate complex asynchronous workflows.
- 🛑 **Dual-Mode Termination** - choose between *Graceful Cancellation* (finishing the current run) or *Immediate Abort* (killing the timer and execution instantly)
- 🔄 **Fluent API** - chainable configuration for a clean, readable developer experience
- 🛡 **Zero-Dependency Safety** - no *"black box"* external code. Pure, **TypeScript**-native implementation with built-in error handling
- 🧩 **Flexible Timing**: handles events with or without delays, maintaining predictable execution
- 🗑️ **Automated Cleanup** - the single-timer engine intelligently self-terminates when the execution queue is empty, ensuring zero idle CPU usage
- 🚦 **UX-Ready State** - use the `isWaiting` flag to drive UI feedback (like *"Saving..."* or *"Typing..."*) without needing extra state variables

<br>

| _Dependencies_     | Often **bundled** (e.g., *Lodash*) |               **Zero** (0)                    |

## 🤹🏼 API

### Types

```ts
type ZepCallback = (...args: any[]) => void
```

Used as a type for the callback provided in the constructor.

<br>

```ts
type ZepErrorHandler = (error: unknown) => void
```

Used as a type for the callback used in handling errors.

<br>

```ts
type ZepEventHandler = () => void
```

Used as a type for `Zep` events.

---

### Methods

```ts
constructor(callback: ZepCallback, time?: number): Zep
```

Creates a new instance of Zep.

- `callback` - the function/callback to debounce.
- `time` - the time limit (in **ms**) for the debouncing.

---

```ts
onCancelled(handler: ZepEventHandler): Zep
```

A handler to call when the execution of `Zep.run()` has been cancelled.  
See also [`Zep.cancel()`](#zep-cancel).

---

```ts
onAborted(handler: ZepEventHandler): Zep
```

A handler to call when the execution of `Zep.run()` has been aborted.  
See also [`Zep.abort()`](#zep-abort).

---

```ts
onBeforeRun(handler: ZepEventHandler): Zep
```

A handler to call before each call to your `callback`.

---

```ts
onAfterRun(handler: ZepEventHandler): Zep
```

A handler to call after each call to your `callback`.

---

```ts
onCompleted(handler: ZepEventHandler): Zep
```

A handler to call after `Zep()` has finished running, i.e. no more calls to the `Zep.run()` method have been issued in the given time-frame.

---

```ts
onError(handler: ZepErrorHandler): Zep
```

A handler to call when an error has occurred during execution.

---

<a id="zep-abort"></a>

```ts
abort(): void
```

Aborts the execution, stops Zep completely and - if applicable - the currently running Timer without waiting for it to finish its execution. See also [`Zep.cancel()`](#zep-cancel).

---

<a id="zep-cancel"></a>

```ts
cancel(): void
```

Stops the execution but **NOT** the current running Timer - if applicable. See also [`Zep.abort()`](#zep-abort).

---

```ts
run(...args): void
```

Runs the callback defined in the constructor if necessary or else debounces it.

---

```ts
writeStats(): void
```

Writes `Zep()` statistical information to the `console`, sample output,

> `[Zep]`: invocations: 500, callback executions: 32, saving of 93.60% calls.

☝ Means that the event was triggered **500** times but `Zep()` debounced it and only executed its handler **32** times instead, the handler was called **93.60%** less than without using `Zep()`.

---

<br>

**Properties**

```ts
executionCount: number
```

Returns the number of callback executions.

---

```ts
isWaiting: boolean
```

Indicates whether `Zep()` is waiting for a Timer to finish its execution, if `true`, `Zep.run()` won't create new Timers when called.

---

```ts
isRunning: boolean
```

Indicates whether a Timer is currently running the `callback` provided in the constructor.

---

```ts
wasCancelled: boolean
```

Indicates whether the execution of `Zep.run()` was cancelled. Execution can be cancelled by calling [`Zep.cancel()`](#zep-cancel).

---

```ts
wasAborted: boolean
```

Indicates whether the execution of `Zep.run()` was aborted. Execution can be aborted by calling [`Zep.abort()`](#zep-abort).

<br>

### 🗒️ Examples
### 🚀 Basic Setup (Fluent API)
`Zep`'s chainable methods allow you to configure your logic and lifecycle hooks in a single, readable block.

`zep-basic.ts`
```ts
import { Zep } from '@igorskyflyer/zep'

const zep: Zep = new Zep((query: string) => {
  // Your expensive task here
  console.log(`Searching for: ${query}`)
}, 1500)
  .onBeforeRun(() => showLoadingSpinner())
  .onAfterRun(() => hideLoadingSpinner())
  .onCompleted(() => {
    // Quantify your performance wins in development
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      zep.writeStats()
    }
  })
  .onError((err) => handleErrors(err))
```

<br>

### 💡 Pro-Tip: UI Syncing
Since `Zep` exposes its internal state, you can bind your UI directly to the debouncer:

`zep-ui.ts`
```ts
// Example: Show a spinner only when Zep is waiting to execute
function renderUI() {
  myLoadingSpinner.visible = zep.isWaiting;
}
```

<br>

### ⌨️ Handling User Input (VS Code QuickPick)
Perfect for waiting until a user stops typing before triggering heavy operations.

`zep-vscode.ts`
```ts
const picker = vscode.window.createQuickPick()

// Cleanest approach: Use an arrow function to preserve 'this' context
picker.onDidChangeValue((value: string) => zep.run(value))
```

> [!TIP]
> Why the arrow function?
> Because `zep.run` is a class method, passing it directly causes it to lose its this context. Always wrap it in an arrow function or use `.bind(zep)`.
>

<br>

### 🏎️ Advanced Control: Abort vs. Cancel
`Zep` gives you granular control over the execution lifecycle that standard debounce wrappers lack.

`zep-advanced.ts`
```ts
// Scenario: User closes a UI component before the debounce finishes
closeButton.onClick(() => {
  // Option A: cancel() 
  // Prevents the next execution, but allows the currently running timer to resolve.
  zep.cancel()

  // Option B: abort() 
  // Immediate hard stop. Clears the timer and halts execution instantly.
  zep.abort()
})
```

<br>

### 📊 Real-world Telemetry
Use `writeStats()` to print the currents stats - the overhead saved.

`zep-stats.ts`
```ts
zep.writeStats()

// Sample Console Output:
// 🧠 [Zep]: invocations: 500, callback executions: 32, saving 93.60% of calls.
```
